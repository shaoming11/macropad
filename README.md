# Shaoming's Macropad
This is my first project that involved the use of KiCad and Fusion 360. 

# Features
- 4 keyboard buttons
- RP2040 microcontroller
- Firmware connected to QMK
- 3D Printable Case using Fusino 360
- PCB designed using KiCad

# What I learned
I learned about the basics of PCB design through KiCad, exclusively working on schematics and PCB layout. Performing DRC helped me understand how to turn schematics into a printable PCB layout.
