# Shaoming's Macropad
This is my first project that involved the use of KiCad and Fusion 360. 

# Features
- 4 keyboard buttons
- RP2040 microcontroller
- Firmware connected to QMK
- 3D Printable Case using Fusion 360
- PCB designed using KiCad

# Bill of Materials

Seeed XIAO RP2040 - since you're soldering, you can mount it SMD style! Please note it is significantly harder than doing it through-hole, so if it's your first time soldering I would avoid it.

MX-Style switches (4x)

0.91 inch OLED displays (1x)

Blank DSA keycaps (White)

M3x16mm screws (4x)

M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts (4x)

# What I learned
I learned about the basics of PCB design through KiCad, exclusively working on schematics and PCB layout. Performing DRC helped me understand how to turn schematics into a printable PCB layout.
